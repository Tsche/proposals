# Introduction                                                                  {#intro}

Packs from structured bindings (@P1061R10) and expansion statements (@P1306R5)
are new language features introduced by C++26. These features both allow
compile-time repetition of destructurable types through either fold expressions
or a for-loop-like syntax.

However there are no standard compile-time sequences of integers that support
these new language features. Such sequences are integral to supporting indexed
access when iterating or folding over multiple sequences.
A simple fix would be to enhance the library template `std::integer_sequence`
implementing the structured bindings protocol, enabling its use with both new
features.

## History

The original revision of this paper was written in 2019. We are revisiting it
now that expansion statements are landing in C++26 as an essential component of
reflection, and packs from structured bindings have been introduced making this
proposal even more useful.

Expansion statements are a new language feature that add compile-time iteration
and code generation to C++.

Originally intended for C++20 with feature approval by EWG for C++20, it failed
to land in time due to design and implementability concerns raised during the
Core wording review.  Those concerns have now been addressed and @P1306R5 was
adopted in C++26.

## An essential C++26 feature

C++26 introduces two new language features that facilitate compile-time
repetition over packs.  We view the ability to use `std::integer_sequence` with
these features as essential to their success.

For example, a common pattern for obtaining a pack of integers of length
`COUNT` within a function template is to take advantage of lambda template
arguments and type deduction on the function-call argument to the lambda to
obtain an integer sequence pack, moving the majority of the function template's
logic into the lambda itself.

```cpp
[]<std::size_t ...INDEX>(std::index_sequence<INDEX...>) {
  // here lies the enclosing function's implementation
} (std::make_index_sequence<COUNT>());
```

Aside from the roundabout and cumbersome syntax, this introduces unnecessary
nesting in code already struggling under the weight of template syntax.  A
cursory GitHub Code Search finds [3.3k][githubsearch] instances this pattern
using lambdas to produce integer packs.  While this is not an every-day
language construct, it is not an uncommon pattern and important within its
domain.  We expect more C++ metaprogramming in the coming years so we need a
more ergonomic solution.

[githubsearch]: https://github.com/search?type=code&q=%2F\[.*\]%3C.*%3E\s*\(.*(index_sequence|integer_sequence)%2B%2F+language%3Ac%2B%2B+-is%3Afork%3A

This paper proposes adding support for the structured bindings protocol to
`std::integer_sequence` to enable refactorings that use `std::integer_sequence`
in an expansion statement or structured binding to produce more readable and
maintainable code.  Embracing the new language features provided by C++26 we
would rewrite code that used the unnecessary lambda pattern as either

```cpp
constexpr auto [...INDEX] = std::make_index_sequence<COUNT>();
// the parameter pack `INDEX` is now usable directly in the function body
// ...
```

or

```cpp
template for(constexpr size_t INDEX : std::make_index_sequence<COUNT>()) {
  // ...
}
```

# Motivation and Use Cases

Expansion statements allow for iteration over a variety of compile-time
sequences such as parameter packs and (`constexpr`) spans of reflections ---
see @P2996 for examples of reflection.  In particular, expansion statements
can iterate and generate code for any type that can, during constant evaluation,
be destructured though the tuple protocol. Additionally, packs can now be
introduced with structured bindings and used with fold expressions.

## Comparing tuples

It is relatively straightforward to implement comparison for `std::tuple` using
a fold expression, but needs either a lambda expression or an auxiliary
function to introduce a context for the pack expansion.

```cpp
template<class ...TTypes, class ...UTypes>
   requires (sizeof...(TTypes) == sizeof...(UTypes))
constexpr
bool operator==(tuple<TTypes...> const & lhs, tuple<UTypes...> const & rhs) {
   auto impl = [&, this]<size_t ...INDEX>(index_sequence<INDEX...>) {
      return ((get<INDEX>(lhs) == get<INDEX>(rhs)) && ...);
   };

   return impl(index_sequence_for<TTypes...>{});
}
```

Note that this is the more readable form of this code, often developers who
are overly familiar with this idiom will eliminate the local variable,
producing code that is opaque to all but the most seasoned developer.

```cpp
template<class ...TTypes, class ...UTypes>
   requires (sizeof...(TTypes) == sizeof...(UTypes))
constexpr
bool operator==(tuple<TTypes...> const & lhs, tuple<UTypes...> const & rhs) {
   return [&, this]<size_t ...INDEX>(index_sequence<INDEX...>) {
      return ((get<INDEX>(lhs) == get<INDEX>(rhs)) && ...);
   }(index_sequence_for<TTypes...>());
}
```

It is straightforward to implement comparison using a fold expression when
`index_sequence` is destructurable.

```cpp
template<class ...TTypes, class ...UTypes>
   requires (sizeof...(TTypes) == sizeof...(UTypes))
constexpr
bool operator==(tuple<TTypes...> const & lhs, tuple<UTypes...> const & rhs) {
   constexpr auto [...INDEX] = index_sequence_for<TTypes...>{};
   return ((get<INDEX>(lhs) == get<INDEX>(rhs)) && ...);
}
```


\newpage
## Implementing `std::tuple::swap`

It is similarly straightforward to implement `tuple::swap` using a fold
expression over the comma operator, but also somewhat of a hack.  This is the
kind of code we would like to be able to write more cleanly using an expansion
statement.

```cpp
template <class ...TTypes>
constexpr
void tuple<TTypes...>::swap(tuple& other) noexcept((is_nothrow_swappable_v<TTypes> and ...))
{
   auto impl = [&, this]<size_t ...INDEX>(index_sequence<INDEX...>) {
      ((void)swap(get<INDEX>(*this), get<INDEX>(other)), ...);
   };

   impl(index_sequence_for<TTypes...>{});
}
```

Note that in addition to the internal use of a lambda expression to create the
parameter pack to fold over, we must also cast the result of the `swap` call to
`void` in case users provide an ADL-discoverable `swap` function that returns
a user defined type that, in turn, provides an overload for the comma operator.
<!--
Finally, I
took the liberty of not replicating the exception specification on the lambda
expression, but is that relying too heavily on compilers to optimize away the
(unneeded) catch-and-abort logic?
  -->

We can eliminate the fold expression and stop worrying about the surprising
corner cases handling ADL-`swap` by using a C++26 expansion statement like so:

```cpp
template <class ...TTypes>
constexpr
void tuple<TTypes...>::swap(tuple& other) noexcept((is_nothrow_swappable_v<TTypes> and ...))
{
   auto impl = [&, this]<size_t ...INDEX>(index_sequence<INDEX...>) {
      template for(constexpr size_t N : {INDEX...}) {
        swap(get<N>(*this), get<N>(other));
      }
   };

   impl(index_sequence_for<TTypes...>{});
}
```

However, there is no easy way to eliminate the lambda expression, as we cannot
iterate over an `integer_sequence` using just the facilities provided in
@P1306R5.  In fact, this "new and improved" version is actually longer than the
single fold expression that it replaces, although we claim that the code is
easier to read with fewer subtleties that readers must be aware of.

The heart of the problem is that expansion statements are an excellent tool to
iterate over a single sequence, but do not provide an index to support
iterating over two sequences in parallel.  We propose that the simplest way to
resolve the concerns is to add the missing pieces that would enable use of
`integer_sequence` in a structured binding.  That is sufficient to support use
in expansion statements, and is general enough to be a feature in its own
right.  With such support, the `tuple::swap` example simplifies to:

```cpp
template <class ...TTypes>
constexpr
void tuple<TTypes...>::swap(tuple& other) noexcept((is_nothrow_swappable_v<TTypes> and ...))
{
   template for(constexpr size_t INDEX : index_sequence_for<TTypes...>{}) {
      swap(get<INDEX>(*this), get<INDEX>(other));
   }
}
```

## Splicing reflections with structured bindings

Supporting decomposition of `integer_sequence`s interacts well with the
proposed changes of @P1061R10 Structured Bindings can introduce a Pack and
@P2686R5 `constexpr` structured bindings.

In a lot of existing code the following pattern is used to introduce a sequence
of integers as a pack of constants.

```cpp
[]<std::size_t ...INDEX>(std::index_sequence<INDEX...>) {
  // ...
} (std::make_index_sequence<COUNT>());
```

Not only is this rather verbose, it introduces a new function scope. This can
be avoided by introducing the pack of integers `INDEX` through a structured
binding instead.

```cpp
constexpr auto [...INDEX] = std::make_index_sequence<COUNT>();
```

As @P1306R5 mentions, introducing a new function scope can be problematic. For
instance, reflections of function parameters (@P3096R12) can be spliced only
within their corresponding function body. Expansion statements alleviate this
issue, but are not usable whenever we want to fold over a pack of reflections
or expand them into an argument list.

For instance, consider the following (invalid) example:

```cpp
void foo(int x, char c) {
   [:expand(parameters_of(^^foo)):]
   >> []<auto ...parameters>(){
      bar([:parameters:]...); // oops
   }
}
```

By using the features introduced in @P1061R10 and @P2686R5, the introduction of
a new function scope can be avoided.

```cpp
void foo(int x, char c) {
   constexpr auto [...INDEX] = std::make_index_sequence<parameters_of(^^foo).size()>();
   bar([:parameters_of(^^foo)[INDEX]:]...);
}
```

# Proposed Solution

## Make `integer_sequence` support structured bindings

`integer_sequence` is missing three things in order to support use in
structured bindings:

* A partial specialization for `tuple_size`
* A partial specialization for `tuple_elememt`
* Overloads of `get<INDEX>()`

The first two bullets are fairly straightforward to implement. For the `get`
function, we propose a single overload taking an `integer_sequence` by value,
as it is an immutable empty type, and likewise returning its result by value.


## Sample implementation

```cpp
template<class T, T ...VALUES>
struct tuple_size<integer_sequence<T, VALUES...>>
     : integral_constant<size_t, sizeof...(VALUES)>
{ };

template<size_t INDEX, class T, T ...VALUES>
struct tuple_element<INDEX, integer_sequence<T, VALUES...>> {
  static_assert(INDEX < sizeof...(VALUES));
  using type = T;
};

template<size_t INDEX, class T, T ...VALUES>
struct tuple_element<INDEX, const integer_sequence<T, VALUES...>> {
  static_assert(INDEX < sizeof...(VALUES));
  using type = T;
};

template<size_t INDEX, class T, T ...VALUES>
constexpr T get(integer_sequence<T, VALUES...>) noexcept {
   static_assert(INDEX < sizeof...(VALUES));
   return VALUES...[INDEX];
}
```
